## Snake

Control the snake to get it to eat the apples.  Each time you eat an apple, you grow.  Every 5 apples you eat, the game speeds up.

Do not crash into your own tail or the walls.  The goal is to stay alive as long as possible.  You get 1 point for each apple you eat.

Keyboard controls: `,` to move left and `.` to move right.  You turn relative to the direction of movement.

## Tetris

Controls:

z rotate counter clockwise
x rotate clockwise
, move left
